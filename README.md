# VisionX: A Comprehensive Image Processing Library in Rust

VisionX is a robust and comprehensive image processing library written in Rust. It aims to provide a wide range of functionalities similar to OpenCV, allowing developers to perform various image processing tasks efficiently and effectively.


## Features

### Basic Image Manipulation

- Reading and Writing Images: Support for various formats like JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, etc.
- Resizing and Cropping: Functions to resize and crop images.
- Color Space Conversion: Conversion between different color spaces (RGB, HSV, Lab, etc.).

### Image Enhancement

- Histogram Equalization: Enhance image contrast.
- Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE): Contrast enhancement for localized areas.
- Brightness and Contrast Adjustment: Modify image brightness and contrast.
- Smoothing (Blurring): Gaussian blur, median blur, bilateral filter.

### Image Restoration

- Noise Reduction: Median filtering, Gaussian filtering, anisotropic diffusion.
- Deconvolution: Methods for deblurring images.

### Image Segmentation

- Thresholding: Global, adaptive, and Otsu's thresholding.
- Edge Detection: Sobel, Canny, Laplacian edge detectors.
- Region-Based Segmentation: Watershed algorithm, region growing.

<!-- ### Geometric Transformations

- Affine Transformations: Translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing.
- Perspective Transformations: Warp images using perspective transformations.
- Image Pyramids: Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids for multi-scale image processing. -->

### Morphological Operations

- Erosion and Dilation: Basic morphological operations.
- Opening and Closing: Noise removal and gap closing.
- Morphological Gradient, Top Hat, Black Hat: Edge detection, highlight and remove small objects.

### Feature Detection and Description

- Corners and Edges: Harris corner detector, Shi-Tomasi corner detector.
- Blob Detection: SimpleBlobDetector, Difference of Gaussians (DoG).
- Feature Descriptors: SIFT, SURF, ORB.

### Feature Matching and Object Recognition

- Template Matching: Finding sub-images within an image.
- Descriptor Matching: Brute-force matcher, FLANN-based matcher.
- Object Detection: Implement YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN (requires integration with deep learning frameworks).

### Image Filtering

- Convolution and Correlation: Custom kernel filtering.
- Non-Linear Filtering: Median filter, bilateral filter.

<!-- ### Image Transformation

- Fourier Transform: FFT for frequency domain analysis.
- Wavelet Transform: Multi-resolution analysis. -->

<!-- ### Contours and Shape Analysis

- Contour Detection: Find contours using algorithms like Suzuki85.
- Shape Analysis: Bounding boxes, minimum enclosing circles, convex hull. -->

<!-- ### Optical Flow and Motion Analysis

- Optical Flow Estimation: Lucas-Kanade, Farneback method.
- Motion Detection: Background subtraction, frame differencing. -->

<!-- ### Machine Learning Integration

- Image Classification: Pre-trained CNN models, transfer learning.
- Object Detection: YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN integration.
- Image Segmentation: Semantic and instance segmentation. -->

<!-- ### Image Compression

- Standard Compression Techniques: JPEG, PNG compression.
- Lossless and Lossy Compression: Implement algorithms for both types. -->

<!-- ### Image Synthesis and Augmentation

- Data Augmentation: Rotation, translation, scaling, flipping, and color jittering.
- Generative Models: Basic integration for GANs (generative adversarial networks). -->

### Utilities

- Drawing Functions: Draw lines, circles, rectangles, text on images.
- Mouse and Keyboard Event Handling: Interaction with images via GUI.

## Installation

```toml
# Add this to your Cargo.toml:
[dependencies]
rustcv = "0.1.0"
```

```rust
// Then, add the following to your crate root:
use visionx;
``` 
## Usage/Examples

Here's a basic example of reading an image, converting it to grayscale, and saving the result:

```rust
use visionx::{image::Image, color::ColorSpace};

fn main() {
    // Load an image from a file
    let img = Image::open("path/to/image.jpg").unwrap();

    // Convert the image to grayscale
    let gray_img = img.convert_color(ColorSpace::Gray);

    // Save the grayscale image
    gray_img.save("path/to/gray_image.jpg").unwrap();
}
```
